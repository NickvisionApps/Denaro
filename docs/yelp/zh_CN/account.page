<title>账户</title>
<p>This page explains all properties of accounts in <app>Denaro</app>. Most of them are shown in <gui>Account Settings Dialog</gui>. This dialog also opens automatically after you create a new account.</p>
<p>Each account is stored in a single <file>*.nmoney</file> file. Files created in an older <em>stable</em> version of <app>Denaro</app> can be safely opened in a more recent <em>stable</em> version of the application. Although the app can run on different platforms (Windows and Linux), the <file>*.nmoney</file> files are 100% compatible between platforms as long as they are from the same application version (i.e. V2023.1.0).</p>
<note style="warning">
	<p>Unstable (Beta and RC) versions of the application can contain bugs or unfinished modifications that can cause data loss. DO NOT use account files that contain real data in unstable versions of the app!</p>
</note>

		<p>There are 3 account types available: 🟣<em>Checking</em>, 🔵<em>Savings</em> and 🟢<em>Business</em>. Account type is only a useful label that is shown in the list of recent accounts and doesn't affect how the application works or what you can do with an account.

		<title>System Currency</title>
		<p>Every time the application starts, it gets data about currency and numbers formatting from your system locale, and this data is used to show currency symbol (unless custom currency is used, see below) and to determine in what format the numbers will be accepted as values for transaction amounts. A few examples:</p>
		<list>
			<item><p>If your locale is <em>English (US)</em>, currency symbol will be set to <em>$</em> and <em>1,000.00</em> will be accepted as a valid number.</p></item>
			<item><p>If your locale is <em>Italian</em>, currency symbol will be set to <em>€</em> and <em>1.000,00</em> will be accepted as a valid number.</p></item>
			<item><p>If your locale is <em>Russian</em>, currency symbol will be set to <em>₽</em> and <em>1000,00</em> will be accepted as a valid number.</p></item>
		</list>
		<note style="advanced">
			<p>On Linux, it is possible to set different locales for system language and formats. Changing these settings varies depending on the desktop environment you are using. Despite differences in the location of these settings on the desktop, changing these settings modify system environment variables, such as <code>LANG</code>, <code>LC_TIME</code>, and <code>LC_MONETARY</code>. <app>Denaro</app> will try to use amount and date formats according to these variables. If the app fails to use the expected formats, please make sure the variables are set correctly via the <code>locale</code> command in a terminal. If you found a bug and want to report it, please provide the output of the <code>locale</code> command to allow developers to reproduce your issue with the same settings.</p>

		<title>密码</title>
		<p>Each account can be password-protected. Adding a password causes an account to become encrypted (making it impossible to read the data without decrypting it using the password). Be careful: if the password is lost, you won't be able to restore the data! A password can also be changed or removed using the account settings dialog of an open account. Removing a password will decrypt the account.</p>
